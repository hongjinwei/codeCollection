 Introduction:
 ================
 this is a luajit timelib, which can provide accurate time 
 

 time return is like this below:
 ================
    1408930398.758409
 
 
 how to build a so:
 ================
 gcc gettime.c -fPIC -shared -o libtime.so
 
    here I use two methods to get accurate CPU time with ffi lib,first is to use my own lib and demo is in gettime.lua, other is to use linux gettimeofday function in c lib and lua call this function directly with the help of ffi.This is in gettimeofday.lua
